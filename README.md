# Analysis of Factors Influencing Used Car Prices

This project aims to analyze a dataset of used cars to understand which factors influence their prices. The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to a used car dealership, helping them understand what consumers value most in a used car.

## Project Overview

This analysis uses a dataset containing information on 426,000 used cars. The data has been sampled from a larger dataset to ensure efficient processing. The objective is to identify key attributes that determine car prices and to suggest strategies for pricing and inventory management.

## Methodology

The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, a widely recognized approach for handling data projects. The following steps were taken:

1. **Business Understanding**: Defining the problem and the objectives from the dealership's perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Exploring the dataset to identify key characteristics and potential influencing factors.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Applying statistical models and machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between car attributes and their prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models' performance to ensure reliability and validity.
6. **Deployment**: Formulating recommendations based on the analysis to guide the dealership's decision-making.

## Key Findings

The analysis identifies several factors that significantly impact the price of used cars. The findings will help the dealership prioritize these attributes in their pricing strategies and better manage their inventory to meet customer preferences.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started
